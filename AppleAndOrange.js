Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tree that yield an abundance of fruit. In the diagram below, the red region denotes his house, where s is the start point, and t is the endpoint. The apple tree is to the left of his house, and the orange tree is to its right. You can assume the trees are located on a single point, where the apple tree is at point a, and the orange tree is at point b.

When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands d units of distance from its tree of origin along the -axis. A negative value of d means the fruit fell d units to the tree's left, and a positive value of d means it falls d units to the tree's right.

Given the value of d for m apples and n oranges, determine how many apples and oranges will fall on Sam's house (i.e., in the inclusive range [s,t])?

Complete the countApplesAndOranges function in the editor below. It should print the number of apples and oranges that land on Sam's house, each on a separate line.

countApplesAndOranges has the following parameter(s):

s: integer, starting point of Sam's house location.
t: integer, ending location of Sam's house location.
a: integer, location of the Apple tree.
b: integer, location of the Orange tree.
apples: integer array, distances at which each apple falls from the tree.
oranges: integer array, distances at which each orange falls from the tree.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of s and t.
The second line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of a and b.
The third line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of m and n.
The fourth line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each apple falls from point .
The fifth line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each orange falls from point .

Output Format

Print two integers on two different lines:

The first integer: the number of apples that fall on Sam's house.
The second integer: the number of oranges that fall on Sam's house.
