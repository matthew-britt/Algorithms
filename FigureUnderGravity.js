ROBINHOOD ASSESSMENT

You are given a rectangular matrix of characters matrix, which represents a 2-dimensional field where each cell is either empty ('.'), contains an obstacle (#), or corresponds to a cell of a connected figure ('F').

Gravity makes the figure fall through the field, until one of its cells reaches the ground, or meets an obstacle. Your task is to return the state of the field after the figure has fallen.

Note that it is guaranteed that the figure is connected, ie. between any two cells of the figure there exists a path which goes through the cells' sides (not through corners).
